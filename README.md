# 🔍 Search Algorithms Comparison Project

## Overview
This project compares **four different search algorithms**:

- Linear Search  
- Binary Search (on a sorted array)  
- Binary Search Tree (BST) Search  
- Red-Black Tree Search  

The project is built in **Python using Flask** with a simple HTML interface.  
Users can input an array, choose a target value, select an algorithm, and view:

- Whether the target was found  
- How long the search took  
- A table comparing all four algorithms  
- A line chart showing running time vs input size  

The main goal is to observe how running time changes as input size grows and how each algorithm behaves differently.

## How to Run the Project

1. Download the project ZIP archive.  
2. Extract the folder to any location on your system.  
3. Open a terminal / command prompt inside the extracted directory (where `main.py` is located).  
4. Install Flask (only required once):
